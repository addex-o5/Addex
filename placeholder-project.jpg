This is a placeholder for a project image.
In a real portfolio, each project card would feature a relevant screenshot or graphic
representing the project (e.g., a website homepage, app interface, or a conceptual design).
Dimensions might be around 400x200 pixels to fit the project card image area.
This placeholder indicates where such an image would be displayed for "Project Title 1", "Project Title 2", etc.
